Red Wine Quality Prediction Project
This project is about predicting the quality of red wine using machine learning algorithms. The dataset used in this project is related to red and white variants of the Portuguese “Vinho Verde” wine. Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.). This dataset can be viewed as a classification task. The classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are many more normal wines than excellent or poor ones). Also, we are not sure if all input variables are relevant. So it could be interesting to test feature selection methods.

Instructions
The project has been divided into four phases: Data Preparation, Modeling, Model Evaluation, and Conclusion. Below are the instructions for each phase:


Data Preparation Phase: 
Explain the dataset used in the project.
Check for missing values and handle them appropriately.
Analyze the distribution of each feature.
Identify and remove any outliers.
Normalize the data.
Modeling Phase(Implementation of 2 regression algorithms): 6pts
Implement two regression algorithms of your choice.
Train each algorithm on the training set.
Evaluate each algorithm on the test set.
Model Evaluation Phase(Include results for 3 metrics and comparison of results): 3pts
Calculate three evaluation metrics for each algorithm: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Compare the performance of both algorithms.
Model Evaluation Phase(Calculate feature importances and visualize them): 3pts
Calculate feature importances for both algorithms.
Visualize the feature importances using a bar chart.
Conclusion (Summarize key insights obtained from the analysis, include one limitation of the analysis and comment on future work that could be done to improve it): 2pts
Summarize the key insights obtained from the analysis.
Mention one limitation of the analysis.
Comment on future work that could be done to improve it.
